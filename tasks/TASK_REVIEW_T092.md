# TASK_REVIEW — T092: Dangerous-sink hits in test files are reported, not scored

> Sibling of `tasks/TASK_GUIDE_T092.md`. Everything here is **filled by the reviewer at Stage
> 4/5** — it is deliberately NOT in the guide, because the implementing agent re-reads the guide on
> every turn and never fills these two sections.
>
> Consumers resolve each section **guide first, this file second** (`.claude/hooks/lib/guide_sections.py`):
> a legacy guide that still carries these sections inline keeps working unchanged, and a stray
> review file can never override an inline section.

## Evidence

| Check | Result | Notes / output snippet |
|-------|--------|------------------------|
| **New test(s) cover Acceptance Criteria (file paths pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [test file path(s) — required before Done] |
| Verification command run | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [paste actual output] |
| Negative cases hold | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| verify | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [what was observed — must literally state "pass" or "fail" here too, e.g. "skill run, feature confirmed working — pass": the merge gate scans this Notes column for the word "pass", not just the Result column] |
| Review scope bounded to the change's blast radius (affected set, not whole repo) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | [what was reviewed vs. skipped, and why] |
| Full smoke suite still green (no regression) | ☐ pass / ☐ fail | |
| **UI: Visual regression (diff or verdict pasted)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [screenshot path or LLM verdict — required for UI tasks, Hard-Stop Gate 6] |
| **UI: Design-system compliance (tokens/colors/typography verified)** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [method used + output] |
| **UI: Responsiveness at target viewports** | ☐ pass / ☐ fail / ☐ N/A | [viewports tested, any overflow findings] |

## Demonstration

> Anchors what this task delivered to an observable before/after pair. BEFORE has no `N/A` path:
> if the task changes executable code, BEFORE is a pasted, timestamped terminal capture taken
> **before any implementation commit exists**; if it does not (docs, templates, skill-instruction
> text), BEFORE is the **verbatim prior content** of what changed — a quoted excerpt, not a command.

**BEFORE** (captured 2026-10-13T07:49Z-07:50Z at base `f758d75`, before any implementation commit; command per repo: `PYTHONPATH=<worktree>/src .venv/bin/python -m easy_verifier.adapters.cli score --repo <repo> --scope project < /dev/null`, run one at a time):

| repo | run (UTC) | security | overall | sink_hits_observed (security pack) |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|------------------------------------|
| coffee-shop-api | 07:49:52-07:49:56 | **18** | 76 | **1** -> fails (earned 0/35) |
| bryony | 07:49:56-07:50:30 | **50** | 59 | **0** -> passes (35/35) |
| kitchd | 07:50:30-07:50:45 | **59** | 56 | **0** -> passes (35/35) |

Derivations (verbatim, method tail elided):
- coffee: `1 dangerous-sink hit(s) in 17 excerpt(s): test/reset-test-db.ts:25 CWE-89 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html) [test path]`; computed_from `test/reset-test-db.ts:25-25`
- bryony: `0 dangerous-sink hit(s) in 16 excerpt(s): none`
- kitchd: `0 dangerous-sink hit(s) in 17 excerpt(s): none` (cites `apps/web/src/routes/AuthGuard.test.tsx:1-44` among its scanned excerpts; no hit)

**AFTER**: [same command, post-change] OR [verbatim excerpt of the new content]

**DELTA**: [one sentence — what a user can now do that they could not before]

**WITNESS**: [who ran it and when — derived from `memory/event-trace/Txxx.jsonl`, never the
implementing agent alone]
